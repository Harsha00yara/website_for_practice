The small and marginal farmers produce small quantity of produce
they cannot be put onto the market,therefore they should be connected ,even the organic terrace farming
they cannot be transported so far ,so they will be connected with the nearby areas,
There is a problem to store all these products ,here there is no need to store all these produce ,we are just connecting the farmers and the consumer directly
The farmers can decide the price of their produce.
Therefore there is no need for adding extra agents to keep their product not wasteful.
In our website there will be a newsfeed of the current market ,so that they can decide the products'rate.
If the farmer uses this website more ,they can get the Gunny bags, bamboo baskets etc., are the materials used for packing.
Their payment will be transacted directly.
If their goods go bad,they will be given ideas to create sundried tomatoes or mangoes,or a homemade yogurt which has additional values.
